## Purpose of the Project

The BabyCAT project aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible coronagraph demonstration testbed. It is designed to help students, researchers, and enthusiasts learn about coronagraphy, build their own setups, and experiment with different configurations.

## Background

The BabyCAT project was designed by a team of scientists and engineers with a passion for optics and astronomy. Our goal is to make advanced optical techniques more accessible to a wider audience.

## Educational Goals

The BabyCAT project is intended to serve as an educational tool, providing hands-on experience with coronagraphy. It is inspired by the need for affordable and easy-to-build optical setups that can be used in classrooms, labs, and at home.
