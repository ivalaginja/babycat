## Purpose of the Project

The BabyCAT project aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible coronagraph demonstration testbed. It is designed to
help students, researchers, and enthusiasts learn about coronagraphy, build their own setups, and experiment with
different configurations.

## Background

The BabyCAT project was designed in 2019 by a team of scientists at the
[Russell B. Makidon Optics Laboratory](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-topics-and-programs/russell-b-makidon-optics-laboratory)
at the [Space Telescope Science Institite](https://www.stsci.edu/).
Its goal is to make advanced optical techniques more accessible to a wider audience.

The first ever BabyCAT coronagraph demonstration bench was built in 2019 and has since been used in various educational
and research settings. Most of the documentation and educational materials were created by SASP
([Space Astronomy Summer Program](https://www.stsci.edu/opportunities/space-astronomy-summer-program)) intern Lucas Batista,
who worked with the RMOL team and STScI's Office of Public Outreach (OPO) during the summer of 2019.

## Educational Goals

The BabyCAT project is intended to serve as an educational tool, providing hands-on experience with coronagraphy. It is
inspired by the need for affordable and easy-to-build optical setups that can be used in classrooms, labs, and transported
easily to conferences and outreach events.

Learners will be able to see how a classic Lyot Coronagraph works, and understand how we can use that to find exoplanets
and other astronomical objects.  

## Where This Setup Is Used

The following institutions and groups have built their own version of BabyCAT:

- **Institution Name**: RMOL at STScI
  - **Location**: Baltimore (MD), USA
  - **Demo name**: BabyCAT

- **Institution Name**: ExEP at JPL, NASA
  - **Location**: Pasadena (CA), USA
  - **Demo name**: BabyCAT 2.0

- **Institution Name**: UC Santa Cruz
  - **Location**: Santa Cruz (CA), USA
  - **Demo name**: sealPUP
