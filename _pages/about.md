## What is a Coronagraph?

A coronagraph is an optical instrument used in astronomical observations. It blocks the light from a star in order to
observe the faint objects around it. This can be used to find exoplanets, study the star's environment, and observe
circumstellar disks.

A coronagraph consists of various masks that, when used in combination, attenuate the starlight while allowing the faint
planet light to shine through. There are many different types of coronagraphs, as the optical masks can be located in
different optical planes (pupil planes and focal planes) and act on either component of the electrical field (amplitude or phase).

The original Lyot coronagraph is a simple design that uses a pair of masks to block the starlight. The
focal-plane mask (FPM) is an opaque, sharp-edge disk in the focal plane placed over the core of the stellar point-spread
function (PSF). The Lyot stop (LS) is an annular mask in the pupil plane that blocks the light diffracted by the FPM.

For more information on coronagraphy, see the [references](#resources) below.

## Purpose of the Project

The BabyCAT project is a demonstration bench that uses a Lyot coronagraph to show how coronagraphy works. It provides 
hands-on experience with coronagraphy and is designed to help students, researchers, and enthusiasts learn about it.
The setup is inspired by the need for easy-to-build optical setups that can be used in classrooms, labs, and transported
easily to conferences and outreach events.

## Background

The BabyCAT project was designed in 2019 by a team of scientists at the
[Russell B. Makidon Optics Laboratory](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-topics-and-programs/russell-b-makidon-optics-laboratory)
at the [Space Telescope Science Institite](https://www.stsci.edu/).
Its goal is to make advanced optical techniques more accessible to a wider audience.

The first ever BabyCAT coronagraph demonstration bench was built in 2019 and has since been used in various educational
and research settings. Most of the documentation and educational materials were created by SASP
([Space Astronomy Summer Program](https://www.stsci.edu/opportunities/space-astronomy-summer-program)) intern Lucas Batista,
who worked with the RMOL team and STScI's Office of Public Outreach (OPO) during the summer of 2019.

**The name:** Why "BabyCAT"? The workhorse project of the RMOL team is the [HiCAT testbed](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240912931S/abstract) - the
"High-contrast imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes" testbed. Since the demo coronagraph was supposed to illustrate a
mini version of HiCAT, the name "BabyCAT" seemed immediately evident.

The second demo bench, BabyCAT 2.0, was also assembled at the Makidon lab and later delivered to ExEP at JPL. Its
upgraded design is the one that is presented on this website.
